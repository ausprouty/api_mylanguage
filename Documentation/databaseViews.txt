-- List all resources used by client 'wsu'
SELECT client_code, type, subject, variant
FROM i18n_client_resources
WHERE client_code = 'wsu'
ORDER BY type, subject, variant;



-- Get the key hashes for the WSU 'hope' bundle
SELECT s.key_hash
FROM i18n_client_resources cr
JOIN i18n_strings s ON s.resource_id = cr.resource_id
WHERE cr.client_code = 'wsu'
  AND cr.type = 'commonContent'
  AND cr.subject = 'hope'
  AND (cr.variant <=> 'wsu');

You already created i18n_resolved_bundle (the row-per-string view). That one lets you read strings with fallback in one hit:

SELECT key_hash, resolved_text
FROM i18n_resolved_bundle
WHERE client_code = 'wsu'
  AND type = 'commonContent'
  AND subject = 'hope'
  AND (variant <=> 'wsu')
  AND (language_hl = 'mrt00' OR language_hl IS NULL);

Keep each new/changed view in a new migration file (donâ€™t edit old ones).

Always make view migrations idempotent with DROP VIEW IF EXISTS ... first

See what views exist:
   SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE Table_type = 'VIEW';

See the exact SQL MySQL stored:
   SHOW CREATE VIEW i18n_client_resources\G
