Perfect — you actually already have everything you need, just under slightly different namespaces. Here’s what you’ve got (from the files you shared):

App\Cron\TranslationQueueProcessor

Role: the “cron-style” loop. Method runCron($seconds, $batch) repeatedly picks queued jobs and processes them.

Depends on: DatabaseService, App\Services\Language\TranslationBatchService.

App\Services\Language\I18nTranslationQueueWorker

Role: the per-job worker (pick → lock → reuse MT/TM if possible → upsert → ack/backoff).

Depends on: DatabaseService.

Methods include: processOne(), deleteJob(), pushBack(), markFailed(), etc.

App\Services\Language\TranslationBatchService

Role: MT engine client (e.g., Google V2), with retry logic.

Method: translateBatch() plus low-level callGoogleV2*.

App\Services\Language\I18nTranslationService

Role: the HTTP-side assembler/translator; enqueues missing strings, applies translations back, updates meta.

Helpers: extractMasterTexts(), applyTranslationsByStringId(), resolveIsoAndName().

So… where should they “belong”?

You don’t need an App\I18n\... folder to proceed. Your current layout is valid:

Keep the loop under App\Cron\TranslationQueueProcessor (something a scheduler/CLI calls).

Keep the per-job worker logic under App\Services\Language\I18nTranslationQueueWorker.

Keep the MT client as a language service.

Keep the HTTP translation service as-is.

If later you want tidy layering, you can rename/move like this (optional, not required now):

App\I18n\Queue\TranslationQueueWorker (move the worker class)

App\Cron\TranslationQueueCron (a thin loop that calls the worker)

…but that’s purely cosmetic and can wait.
